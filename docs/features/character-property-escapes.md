A <dfn>Character Property Escape</dfn> is an escape sequence used to match a character with a specific character property.

#### Syntax

> NOTE: The following syntax is an example based on some of the supported engines. For specific engine support, see [Engines](#engines).

-->

- <code>\\p*X*</code> &mdash; Where *X* is a single character. Matches a character that has the property *X*.
- <code>\\p{*name*}</code> &mdash; Where *name* is a predefined property name. Matches a character that has the property *name*.
- <code>\\P*X*</code> &mdash; Where *X* is a single character. Matches a character that does not have the property *X*.
- <code>\\P{*name*}</code> &mdash; Where *name* is a predefined property name. Matches a character that does not have the property *name*.
