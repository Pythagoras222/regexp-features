A <dfn>Negated Posix Character Class</dfn> is a member of a [Character Class] set that specifies a named, pre-defined set of excluded characters.

#### Syntax

> NOTE: The following syntax is an example based on some of the supported engines. For specific engine support, see [Engines](#engines).

- <code>\[\[:^*name*:\]\]</code> &mdash; Where *name* is in a set of predefined names. Matches any character not in the set.
