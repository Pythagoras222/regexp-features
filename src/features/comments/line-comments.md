# description
A <dfn>Line Comment</dfn> is a sequence of characters starting with `#` and ending with `\n` (or the end of the pattern) that is ignored by pattern matching and can be used to document a pattern.

# syntax
- <code>#â€¦<strong>\n</strong></code> &mdash; The rest of the line starting from `#` is removed from the pattern. Only supported when the `x` (extended mode) [RegExp flag] is set.
