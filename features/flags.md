# Feature: Flags

<dfn>Flags</dfn> control certain aspects of the matching behavior of a pattern.

#### Syntax

> NOTE: The following syntax is an example based on some of the supported engines. For specific engine support, see [Engines](#engines).

<!--
'syntax' sources:
  - [](../../src/features/flags-and-modifiers/flags.syntax.md)
-->

The following flags are supported:
- `i` &mdash; Ignore Case. Matches [character classes] using a case-insensitive comparison.
- `m` &mdash; Multiline. Causes the [anchors] `^` and `$` to match the start and end of each line (respectively), rather than the start and end of the input.
- `s` &mdash; Singleline. Causes the [wildcard] `.` to match newline characters.
- `x` &mdash; Extended Mode. Ignores whitespace in a pattern. Spaces must instead be represented by `\s` or `\ ` (an escaped space).

## Engines

| [Boost.Regex](../engines/boost.regex.md) | ✔ |
