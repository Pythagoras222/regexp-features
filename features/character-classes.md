A <dfn>Character Class</dfn> is an *Atom* that specifies a set of characters to match a single character in the set.

### Syntax

> NOTE: The following syntax is an example based on some of the supported engines. For specific engine support, see [Engines](#engines).

- `[…]` &mdash; Where `…` is one or more single characters or character class escapes, excluding `^` at the start and `-` between two entries in the set. Matches a character in the set. Example: `[abc]` matches `a`, `b`, or `c`.
- <a id="negated-character-class"></a>`[^…]` &mdash; Where `…` is one or more single characters or character class escapes, excluding `-` between two entries in the set. Matches any character not in the set. Example: `[^abc]` matches `d`, `e`, or `f`, etc., but not `a`, `b`, or `c`.
- <a id="character-class-range"></a><code>[<em>a</em>-<em>z</em>]</code> &mdash; Where *a* and *z* are single characters or character escapes. Matches any character in the range between *a* and *z* (inclusive). Example: `[a-c]` matches `a`, `b`, or `c`, but not `d`.
